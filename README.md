Adapter for adding a 10-pin JTAG/SWD connector to the included ST-Link attached to STM Nucleo boards. The board can be soldered directly to the nucleo-stlink, or a header can be added for use with jumper wires between the adapter board and the nucleo-stlink. The board can also be used as a breakout for programming & debugging projects built on a breadboard.
